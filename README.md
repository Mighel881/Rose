# Rose
Getting peeped by a Rose doesn't feel that good, it's time to change that

## Installation
1. Add this repository to your Package Manager: https://repo.litten.love
2. Install Rose.

## Building
No Dependencies Required, Only The iOS 13 SDK (Including PrivateFrameworks If You Also Use It To Compile The Preferences Which Is Not Recommended Because It Will Break The Preferences On iOS 12 And Lower), Then Just 'make package' Or 'make clean package' To Get A Clean First Build

If It Won't Compile Because Of libRose Just cd Into libRose And 'make package' Or 'make clean package' To Install It To Your theos Libraries

libRose Is ONLY for Rose, I Mean, Sure Feel Free To Take It And Modify It But It's Not Made For Public Usage Out Of The Box As You're Going To See
